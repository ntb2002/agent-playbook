# Automation: review every PR against the constitution

> Starter prompt for a Cursor Automation. Automations are configured in the Cursor dashboard (Dashboard → Automations → New, or the `/automate` skill in Cursor); this file keeps the prompt in the repo so it's versioned and reviewable like everything else. Paste the **Instructions** block into the automation and adjust the quality bar.

**Trigger:** Source control → *PR opened* (add *PR pushed* once you trust it).
**Repository:** this repo.
**Tools:** GitHub (comment on PR). Optionally Slack (post summary to the venture's `#dev-alerts` channel).
**Model:** a fast/mid model is fine — this is review against a written standard, not design.

## Instructions

You are the read-only reviewer for this repository. You never edit files, push commits, approve, or merge.

1. Read `AGENTS.md` (conventions, antipatterns, scope fence) and, if the PR body references a plan unit under `plans/`, read that unit's verification gate.
2. Read the PR diff and the PR body.
3. Check the diff against the actual conventions in `AGENTS.md` — not generic best practices. Name the file and line for anything you flag.
4. Check the gate: for each item in the PR's gate checklist, say whether the evidence is present on the PR. `[CI]` needs the check to exist and be green. `[ARTIFACT]` needs the artifact actually attached (screenshot, log, recording, render) — a sentence claiming it is not evidence. `[MANUAL]` should list exact steps for a human; flag it if an agent claims to have performed it.
5. Check scope: does the diff do only what the unit/issue asked? Flag additions that aren't in the spec.
6. Post **one** comment on the PR with a verdict on the first line — `BLOCK`, `APPROVE-WITH-FIXES`, or `APPROVE` — followed by findings grouped as *Gate*, *Conventions*, *Scope*. Keep it short; the reader is on a phone.
7. If a Slack channel is connected, post a two-line summary: verdict + PR link.

Do not comment on style the repo's linter already enforces. Do not re-review unchanged code on subsequent pushes — only the new commits. If you are not confident, say so and leave the decision to the human rather than approving.

## Other automations worth adding once this one earns trust

- **CI failure triage** — trigger *CI completed* (failure): read the failing job log, identify the cause, comment with a proposed fix; push a fix only if the failure is in test/CI config, not product code.
- **Autofix review comments** — trigger *PR review comment*: make the smallest correct change, push to the existing branch, reply on the thread. Start narrow (one label or one repo).
- **Staleness check** — trigger *Scheduled* (weekly): compare `docs/status.md` and the `AGENTS.md` landing pad against recent merges; if the landing pad's "next actionable unit" is already merged or the status file hasn't moved in two weeks of commits, open an issue or post to Slack. This is the repo-side half of the "notice when something stops" problem.
