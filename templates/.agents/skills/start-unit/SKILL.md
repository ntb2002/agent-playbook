# /start-unit $ARGUMENTS

Begin exactly one issue — no scope creep. `$ARGUMENTS` is an issue id (`SP-7`, `NV-3`, or `#42` on the GitHub tier).

1. **Fetch the issue from the declared tracker.** `AGENTS.md`'s landing pad names it. Linear → Linear MCP (`get_issue`) as the first read. GitHub Issues → `gh issue view <n> --comments`. That tracker is the only place work comes from: do not search the other tracker, Notion, or a planning markdown file for "the issue." **If you cannot fetch it, stop and say so** — do not guess from `plans/` and do not proceed on a pasted summary unless the human explicitly says the tracker is down. If the human named sub-issues, fetch those too.
2. Confirm the issue is in **Todo** (or was filed straight into In Progress by a Fast-lane approval in this conversation) and that its **entry dependency** is satisfied (merged PRs, infra, `blocked by` links). If not, stop and say so. Check the WIP limit: if another issue is already being built in this repo, stop and ask which one to continue.
3. Load the spec. **The issue is the spec.** If a Deep-lane plan file exists at `plans/features/<issue-id>-*.md`, read it too, and prefer the issue's acceptance criteria if they disagree. If the issue still has a `## Needs human` section or no acceptance criteria, stop — it isn't ready to build.
4. Read the relevant conventions: `AGENTS.md` + scoped `.cursor/rules/*.mdc` for the files you'll touch; `docs/architecture.md` for the area.
5. Restate the **verification gate** as your definition of done; keep it visible.
6. **Branch from GitHub's `main`, never your local copy.** PRs merge on GitHub, so local `main` is usually behind even on a laptop, and a branch cut from it silently misses merged work.
   - `git status` first. If there are uncommitted changes, stop and ask. Don't carry another unit's work onto this branch.
   - **Move the issue Todo → In Progress** in the tracker (Linear MCP `save_issue`; GitHub tier: nothing to move, since the state mapping has no In Progress label and the PR shows it). This is the one status move you make, and only because the human started this unit. It records their approval; don't move any other issue or state.
   - `git fetch origin`, then `git checkout --no-track -b <issue-id>-<slug> origin/main`. The tracker auto-links the PR from the id.
   - **Resuming** a branch that already exists: check it out and `git merge origin/main`, so it has everything merged since it was cut.

   Implement only what this issue specifies. In-scope tweaks you discover are commits here; out-of-scope finds become a new issue (Fast lane if you're fixing it now, a one-line Triage capture if not) — never silent extra scope. Follow `.cursor/rules/model-policy.mdc`.
7. **Work autonomously inside the box** (`AGENTS.md` → *Autonomy inside the box*): iterate until the gate passes, call subagents as needed, never edit a protected check, and escalate on a loop bound rather than pressing on. A loop issue runs its `## Loop spec` exactly.
8. As you go, verify each gate item and gather its evidence. For iOS `[ARTIFACT]` taps, the Xcode MCP must appear in **this** session's live tool catalog (`DeviceInteraction*`). Cached descriptors on disk do not count. If it is absent, gather `[CI]` evidence and leave the taps for a local session with Xcode connected — do not invent a `[MANUAL]` human for work the MCP would have done.

Don't update status docs or open the PR yet — that's `/close-unit`.
