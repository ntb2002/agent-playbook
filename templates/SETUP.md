# Per-project setup checklist

Run through this once when a project graduates to "can break." Skip layers a project hasn't earned yet (see the maturity ladder in `PLAYBOOK.md`).

## Local (per clone / per machine)

- [ ] `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` — enable the pre-commit hook (secret-scan + lint/test). Bootstrap sets this automatically; cloud VMs use `.cursor/environment.json`.
- [ ] Confirm the hook fires: a commit with a fake `sk-ant-…` or `sk-proj-…` string in a staged file should be blocked. If `gitleaks` is installed locally, the hook uses it automatically.

## GitHub (once per repo)

- [ ] Push the repo to GitHub; confirm CI runs on the first PR.
- [ ] **Settings → Branches → Add ruleset** for `main`: require a PR, require the CI status check, require up-to-date branches.
  - ⚠️ **Free + private repo:** GitHub won't *enforce* rulesets (wants Team/Pro). Not a blocker — CI still runs and shows on every PR; you keep the branch→PR→merge discipline, you just lose the hard block. For free hard enforcement, **make the repo public** (also good for a portfolio); or **GitHub Pro** (~$4/mo) protects private branches. Defer until others can merge or real users exist.
- [ ] **Settings → Code security:** enable Secret scanning + Push protection.
- [ ] (Real users) Add a bot reviewer — Cursor Bugbot or CodeRabbit — on PRs.

## Cloud agents (Cursor / Claude Code)

- [ ] `.cursor/environment.json` runs `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` on install — fresh VMs enable the hook automatically. Add stack-specific install steps there as the project matures.
- [ ] Confirm the agent can `gh pr create` (auth available in the environment).

## Slack + GitHub mobile orchestration

- [ ] Install the **GitHub app for Slack**; subscribe a channel to the repo: `/github subscribe <owner>/<repo> pulls checks`.
- [ ] Install **GitHub mobile**; turn on notifications for review requests + CI.
- [ ] (If using Cursor cloud agents from Slack) connect the Cursor Slack integration so you can launch agents by message.
- [ ] Sanity check the loop: launch a trivial agent task → PR opens → Slack pings → review + merge from phone.

## Graduate when ready

- [ ] Dedicated secret scanning in CI (gitleaks) for defense-in-depth beyond push protection.
- [ ] Staging environment: `main` → staging; a tagged `release` → prod.
- [ ] Platform CI (e.g. macOS runners for iOS) once a test target exists.
